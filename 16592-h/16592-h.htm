<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>We understand that it has now been decided that the Ex-Kaiser will
  travel to England for his trial by way of the Channel Tunnel.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A new coal war is anticipated by <i>The Daily Express</i>. The
  difficulty is in knowing where the last coal war ended and this one will
  begin.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that the Government fixture card is not yet complete and
  they still have a few open dates for Peace Conferences (away matches) for
  medium teams.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The world's largest blasting-furnace has been opened at Ebbw Vale. It
  is expected however that others will flare up immediately the <font
  class="sc">Chancellor's</font> proposals go through.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Militarism has created a dragon whose fangs will never properly be
  drawn," announces a writer in a Sunday paper. This charge against <font
  class="sc">Mr. Winston Churchill's</font> dentist is, in our opinion,
  most unkind.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The report that the Turks had appealed to the Allies to stop the new
  war in Asia Minor turns out to be incorrect. What the Turks demand is
  that the Allies shall stop the Greek end of it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"I would like to take a great piece of England back to America as a
  souvenir of the happy time I have recently spent there," exclaimed Miss
  <font class="sc">Mary Pickford</font> to a reporter in Belgium.
  Arrangements, we hear, are now being hastily made to offer her the whole
  of Ireland if she will take it away during this month.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to a local paper a lawyer living in Birmingham, returning
  unexpectedly from the theatre, discovered two burglars at work in his
  library. It is reported, however, that the intruders with great presence
  of mind immediately retained him for their defence.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Several workhouses in the South of England now possess tennis-courts
  and bowling-greens. It is satisfactory to note that preparations are at
  last being made to receive the New Poor.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We are glad to learn that the two members of a well-known club in the
  City who inadvertently took away their own umbrellas have now agreed to
  exchange same, so that the reputation of the club shall not suffer.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Warwickshire miner summoned for not sending his child to school is
  reported to have pleaded that he saw a red triangle danger notice above
  the word "school" and therefore kept his daughter away.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"We must have support," said the <font
  class="sc">Postmaster-General</font> last week. We can only say that we
  always buy our stamps at one of his post-offices.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A little domestic tragedy was enacted in London last week. It appears
  that a small boy, on being offered a penny by his mother, who had just
  returned from the winter sales, refused it, saying that he was not
  allowed to accept money from strangers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>An official of the New York Y.W.C.A. inquires whether a woman of
  thirty years is young. A more fair question would be, "When is a woman
  thirty years of age?"</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>President <font class="sc">C.W. Eliot</font>, of Harvard University,
  says Britishers drink tea because it feeds the brain. Our own opinion is
  that we drink it because we have tasted our coffee.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>So many servant-girls are being enticed from one house to another that
  several houses now display the notice, "Visitors are requested to refrain
  from stealing the servants."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Under a new Order public-houses will not open until seven in the
  evening on Sundays. This seems to be another attempt to discourage early
  rising on that day.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Two men have been arrested at Oignies, Pas de Calais, for selling
  stones as coal. We fancy we know the coal-dealer from whom they got this
  wrinkle.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Speaking at Sheffield University last week, Sir <font class="sc">Eric
  Geddes</font> said he hoped to see the day when there would be a degree
  of Transport. What we're getting now, we gather, can't really be called
  Transport at all.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A live mussel measuring six inches has been found inside a codfish at
  Newcastle. We expect that if the truth was known the mussel snapped at
  the cod-fish and annoyed it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A soldier arrested at Dover told the police he was <i>Sydney
  Carton</i>, the hero of <i>The Tale of Two Cities</i>. He is supposed to
  be an impostor.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A market-gardener in Surrey is said to be the double of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Winston Churchill</font>. Since this announcement it is stated
  that the poor fellow has been inundated with messages of sympathy.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The secret of success," says Mr. <font class="sc">W. Harris</font>,
  "is hard work." Still, some people would scorn to take advantage of
  another man's secret.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Wives, said the Judge of the Clerkenwell County Court recently, are
  not so ignorant that they do not know what their husband's earnings are.
  There is no doubt, however, that many workmen's wives simply pocket the
  handful of bank-notes their husbands fling them on Saturday night without
  stopping to count them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>There were no buyers, it is stated, for fifty thousand blankets
  offered by the Disposals Board last week. We have all along maintained
  that, though it would take time, the Board would wear its adversaries
  down.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to an official list recently published the Government
  employs over three thousand charwomen. The number is said to be so great
  that they have to take it in turns to empty Mr. <font class="sc">Austen
  Chamberlain's</font> portfolio.</p>

<h2>A CRICKET MANNERISM.</h2>

  <p>A writer commented recently in an article in <i>Punch</i> on the
  advantage to a cricketer of some harmless mannerism, giving as an
  instance Mr. P.F. <font class="sc">Warner's</font> habit of hitching up
  the left side of his trousers and patting the ground seven times with his
  bat. This homely touch reminded me irresistibly of Rankin. Not that
  Rankin resembles Mr. <font class="sc">Warner</font> even remotely in any
  other way. But Rankin has a mannerism, one which is fairly harmless, too,
  as a general rule. If on one occasion, of which I will tell you, it had
  unfortunate results, there was then a combination of circumstances for
  which Rankin was not entirely responsible. That much I now feel myself
  able to admit. At the time I could see nothing good about Rankin at
  all.</p>

  <p>Rankin resides in our village of Littleborough, and is by trade what
  is known as a jobbing gardener. On Thursdays he is my gardener, on
  Wednesdays Mrs. Dobbie's gardener, and so on. On Saturday afternoons he
  plays cricket. Or at least he dresses in (among other garments) a pair of
  tight white flannel trousers and a waistcoat, and joins the weekly
  game.</p>

  <p>Recently we met in deadly combat the neighbouring village of
  Smallwick. Away into the unchronicled past runs the record of these
  annual contests. Each village hints that it has gained the greater number
  of victories; each is inclined in its heart to believe that the other one
  has actually done so&mdash;because, as I suppose, the agony of defeat
  leaves a more lasting impression than the joy of victory. But I digress.
  We have not even got to Rankin's mannerism yet.</p>

  <p>Rankin's mannerism is the habit of plunging his hands into his trouser
  pockets. A very ordinary one, you will say; but not when carried to the
  extent to which Rankin carries it. It is useless for Rankin to field at
  short slip, for instance. The only time he did so a catch struck him
  sharply in the lower chest (and fell to the ground, of course) before he
  had time to take his hands out of his pockets. When he is batting he
  crams one hand into his pocket between each delivery. As he wears a large
  batting glove and his trousers are very tight (as I mentioned before)
  this is a matter of some difficulty. In fact we usually attribute the
  smallness of his scores to its unsteadying effect.</p>

  <p>How he ever survived five years of military service without being shot
  for persistently carrying his hands in his pockets while on parade, to
  the detriment of good order and military discipline, I can never
  understand. Surely some Brass-hat, inspecting Rankin's regiment, must
  have noticed that Rankin's hands were in his pockets when he should have
  been presenting arms? I can only presume that they all loved Rankin, and
  love is blind. Well, he is quite a good chap. I like him myself.</p>

  <p>We now come to the day of the Smallwick <i>v.</i> Littleborough
  match.</p>

  <p>Smallwick lost the toss and went out to field, and, as one of their
  players had not arrived, Rankin went with them as a substitute.</p>

  <p>We lost three wickets for only ten runs, and then I went in. It was
  one of my rare cricket days. I felt, I knew, that I should make
  runs&mdash;not much more than twenty, of course, but then twenty is a big
  score for Littleborough. And I felt like twenty at least.</p>

  <p>Rankin was fielding at deep long-on, close to the tent; but they had
  no one at square leg, which is my special direction on my twenty days.
  Presently the bowler offered me a full pitch on the leg side. I timed it
  successfully, and had no doubt of having added four to my score, when, to
  my astonishment, I saw a fieldsman running from the direction of the
  hedge. The next moment he had brought off a very creditable catch.</p>

  <p>It did not dawn on me at first that this was their eleventh man,
  arrived at that moment. When it did, I could not help laughing to think
  that he should imagine he could rush in like that while his substitute
  was still fielding. Then I heard the bowler appeal to the umpire, and to
  my horror I heard the umpire (their umpire) say "Out."</p>

  <p>"But they can't have twelve men fielding," I cried. "The substitute is
  still there."</p>

  <p>"You're out, Sir," said the umpire haughtily. "The substitoot has
  already retired. 'E's standing there watching the game with 'is 'ands in
  'is pockets."</p>

  <p>So <i>that</i>'s the idea.</p>

<h2>PHILOSOPHERS.</h2>

  <p>We are all different, and often our differences are of the widest.
  Some men can be knocked prostrate by the most trifling disappointment,
  while others can extract comfort or even positive benefit from what looks
  like complete disaster&mdash;such as the Cambridge youth I met last week,
  raving about <font class="sc">Turner's</font> "Fighting Téméraire."</p>

  <p>"But I didn't know you were interested in pictures," I said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I've always been, in a way," he replied; "but it wasn't till
  the rain ruined the first day of the Varsity match that I ever had a real
  chance to get to the National Gallery, and when it came down like blazes
  again on Tuesday I went back there. Did you ever see such painting? And
  the pathos of it too! And then that frosty morning scene in the same
  room! Why, <font class="sc">Turner</font> was too wonderful."</p>

  <p>How some of the other dampened enthusiasts tided over their loss I can
  only guess; but this ardent one reminded me of the Shipwrecked
  Entomologist, and I placed him on a niche somewhere near that radiant
  soul.</p>

  <p>And who was he?</p>

  <p>Well, he was the curator of his own department in some Indian
  museum&mdash;I think at Calcutta&mdash;and when the time came for his
  holiday he took a passage for Japan on a little tramp steamer. Everything
  went well until a few hours out of Shanghai, when a typhoon began to blow
  with terrific force. The ship was driven on the coast of Korea, where she
  set about breaking up, and only with the greatest difficulty did the
  passengers and crew get to shore, bruised and saturated, without anything
  but their clothes and what their pockets could hold. Some lives were
  lost, but my man was saved.</p>

  <p>It was a desolate part, with nothing but the poorest huts for shelter,
  dirty and verminous, so that the discomforts of the land were almost
  equal to the perils of the sea.</p>

  <p>Naturally, on his return to Calcutta the curator was plied with
  questions. How did be feel about it? Wasn't it an awful experience? If
  ever a man deserved sympathy it was he. And so forth. But he wouldn't
  rise.</p>

  <p>"Sympathy?" he said. "Good Heavens! I don't want sympathy. Why, I had
  the time of my life. Do you know that during the night in that Korean
  hovel I found five absolutely new kinds of bug."</p>

<h2>MY RAT.</h2>

  <p>He visits me at least once every day. His favourite time is the hour
  of tea, when the family and staff may be expected to be at home; but
  sometimes he honours us with an additional call at the luncheon hour. He
  emerges from his deep hole beneath an ivy root, takes the air up and down
  the paths of my rockery, glances in at the drawing-room window, passes on
  to the back premises, and so home.</p>

  <p>There is nothing furtive about his movements. His manner is that of
  one who has purchased the mansion and its appurtenances but does not wish
  to disturb the sitting tenants. It is his duty to sea that the premises
  are properly cared for, but for the present he has no desire to take
  possession. It is beautiful weather and the simple life out-of-doors
  contents him.</p>

  <p>He is a brown rat. I write of his sex with confidence because his
  urbanity is that of a polished gentleman of the world; no feminine
  creature could ever display it. A female rat who had bought the house
  would eagerly try to get in and drive us forth. But not so my rat. He
  discharges the function of a landlord as considerately as he can; after
  all, even a landlord must be allowed the rights of inspection of his own
  property.</p>

  <p>At first I regarded him as merely an ordinary intrusive brown rat. I
  laid down poisonous pills composed of barium carbonate and flour. He did
  not take offence; he understood our human limitations. He showed by a
  jaunty cock of the eye that all to understand is all to pardon. His daily
  visits continued without abatement.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested to me that we should await his regular calls
  with dogs, blood-thirsty terriers. I cannot take so scurvy an advantage
  of his confidence.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I have sinned. The fault is less mine than that of the High Court of
  Parliament. I was bidden to study the penalties laid down for those who
  do not proceed to the destruction of their rats. When I weighed my
  landlord rat against five treasury notes I confess that in an hour of
  meanness I permitted the notes to tip the scale. I prepared phosphor
  paste and laid a trail of this loathsome condiment upon the path trodden
  every afternoon by my rat.</p>

  <p>He came as usual on the day after that on which I had basely planned
  his murder&mdash;Heaven forgive me!&mdash;that I might escape a trifling
  fine, and he deigned to partake of my hospitality. Twenty-four hours
  later, when duty summoned him once more at the hour of tea, his eye was
  dim and he staggered slightly in his gait. He was still able to go his
  rounds, but since that tragic afternoon I have seen him no more.</p>

  <p>My family eyes me with suspicion. They look for the rat, which no
  longer arrives at his accustomed hour. My cook has given notice. I alone
  bear the burden of the fatal secret.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Saved! What care I for five paltry pounds now that our rat has
  recovered from his indisposition and has hastened to re-visit his
  property? The phosphor paste, like arsenic, has added brightness to his
  eye and brought a beautiful lustre to his smooth brown coat. He has
  softened in his manner and tends towards friendship. There is less of the
  grand air, less assertion of the vast gap which yawns between the
  landlord and the tenant. Presently, if I continue to prove worthy of his
  condescension, my rat will eat phosphor paste out of my hand.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE HORSE.</h2>

  <p>[The following fragment is taken from the play, <i>David Lloyd
  George</i>, which we understand may some day be produced at the Lyric
  Opera House, Hammersmith, as a companion-piece to <i>Abraham
  Lincoln</i>.]</p>

  <p>The scene is laid in the House of Commons, where Sir <font
  class="sc">Frederick Banbury</font> has moved the rejection of the Poets
  and Verse (Nationalisation) Bill.</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p><i>Sir <font class="sc">Frederick Banbury</font> is speaking.</i></p>

      <p class="i2">Whether they write a little or a lot,</p>
      <p class="i2">They won't write <i>anything</i>. There will not be</p>
      <p class="i2">Sufficient stimulus. It's human nature,</p>
      <p class="i2">And human nature is unchangeable.</p>
      <p class="i2">Do you imagine, Sir, that <font class="sc">Keats</font> or <font class="sc">Shelley</font></p>
      <p class="i2">Would have produced such valuable work,</p>
      <p class="i2">So large an output, if this precious Bill</p>
      <p class="i2">Had been in operation at the time?</p>
      <p class="i2">We should have had no <font class="sc">Shakspeare</font>. And, besides,</p>
      <p class="i2">It means the death of British poetry,</p>
      <p class="i2">Because we can't continue to compete</p>
      <p class="i2">With foreign countries.</p>

      <p class="i2">We shall support it. On the other hand,</p>

      <p class="i2">A Bill which, it is not too much to say,</p>

      <p class="i2">I will not longer, Sir, detain the House;</p>
      <p class="i2">Indeed I cannot profitably add</p>
      <p class="i2">To what I said in 1892.</p>
      <p class="i2">Speaking at Manchester I used these words:&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i4">"If in the inconstant ferment of their minds</p>

      <p class="i4">Of all that wealth of intellect and power</p>
      <p class="i4">Which has made England great. If that be true</p>
      <p class="i4">We may put <font class="sc">Finis</font> to our history.</p>

      <p class="i2">The horse is very tired, and it is raining.</p>
      <p class="i2">Poor little horse! But yonder, at the top,</p>
      <p class="i2">Look, look, there is a rainbow in the sky,</p>
      <p class="i2">The promise of fair weather, and beyond</p>
      <p class="i2">There is a splendidly-appointed stable,</p>
      <p class="i2">With oats and barley, or whatever 'tis</p>

      <p class="i2">That's where the horse is going. But, you see,</p>
      <p class="i2">The horse has got to climb the great big hill</p>
      <p class="i2">Before he gets there. Oh, you must see that.</p>
      <p class="i2">Then let us cease this petty bickering;</p>
      <p class="i2">Let us have no more dragging at the reins.</p>
      <p class="i2">What <i>is</i> this Bill when all is said and done?</p>
      <p class="i2">Surely this House, surely this mighty nation,</p>
      <p class="i2">Which did so much for horses in the War,</p>
      <p class="i2">Will not desert this little horse at last</p>

      <p class="i2">Newspaper-owners&mdash;<i>I</i> know who they are&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i2">About this Bill! No, no, of course it won't.</p>
      <p class="i2">We will take heart and gallop up the hill,</p>
      <p class="i2">We will climb up together to the rainbow;</p>
      <p class="i2">We will go on to where the rainbow ends&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i2">I know where that is, for I am a Welshman.</p>
      <p class="i2">It is a field, a lovely little field,</p>
      <p class="i2">Where there are buttercups and daffodils,</p>
      <p class="i2">And long rich grass and very shady trees.</p>
      <p class="i2">Hold on a little, and the horse will get there,</p>

<h2>WORD CHAINS.</h2>

  <p>Sheila Davies and her brother had cycled over to play tennis. They
  sat, with John and myself, on the steps and watched the rain falling.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of general interest," said Arthur Davies to me, "when a
  man invites his friends and neighbours over to play tennis and it pours
  with rain all the time, what is the correct thing for him to do?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of general interest," I answered, "the good host will
  send the ladies to play the piano, if any, and to talk scandal, whether
  there is any or not. He will himself conduct the men of the party to the
  billiard-room or the smoking-room and offer them cigarettes and
  whisky&mdash;if any."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Davies, "then it isn't usual just to keep them sitting
  miserably on the steps watching the net float away?"</p>

  <p>John, on whose steps we were sitting, felt the need of speech.</p>

  <p>"I have often wondered," he said, turning to Miss Davies, "how your
  brother ever got into such a nice family as yours. How do you keep so
  cheerful with it always about?"</p>

  <p>"One gets used to it in time," said Miss Davies.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," said John. "After all, we have the same sort of family
  disaster in Alan, but we manage to bear up."</p>

  <p>Davies rose.</p>

  <p>"You and I don't seem popular here," he said to me. "Will you conduct
  me to the billiard-room or the smoking-room? I am in need of a wash."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of general interest," said John to Miss Davies, "is it
  the correct thing to wash <i>before</i> setting out to visit friends, or
  can it be left until some hours after arrival?"</p>

  <p>Miss Davies sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"If you two are going to sit here thinking of clever remarks to make
  about each other I shall go home. For goodness' sake let's pretend we are
  enjoying ourselves."</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> enjoying myself," said John plaintively; "I've been
  wanting to say what I really think of your brother for years."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't do it now. Things are miserable enough without having
  discussions on Arthur. Let's all have a game at something, shall we?"</p>

  <p>"Splendid idea," said her brother. "What about tennis?"</p>

  <p>"We might get into bathing togs and play polo," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"That's not a bad notion," said John, "and then he needn't have a wash
  until to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I suggest," continued Miss Davies, "that we play at Word Chains."</p>

  <p>Davies buried his face in his hands and groaned.</p>

  <p>"It sounds fine," I said gallantly. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's really a sort of mind exercise. They recommend it in those
  courses, you know," said Miss Davies, "er&mdash;'it stimulates a logical
  sequence in reasoning and quickens the mental processes.'"</p>

  <p>"Is that what they say about it?" asked John fearfully.</p>

  <p>"But it makes a splendid game," added Miss Davies eagerly. "Let me
  explain it to you and you'll see. First of all we think of a word, such
  as&mdash;er&mdash;'margarine.'"</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked John.</p>

  <p>"It's part of the game, of course," said Miss Davies indignantly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see&mdash;of course. How stupid of me!" said John.</p>

  <p>"Then we think of another word quite different, such as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Hippopotamus,'" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"That's right," said Miss Davies.</p>

  <p>I stood up and bowed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm hanged!" said John. "Jolly good, Alan. However did you
  guess it? Has he won?" he asked Miss Davies.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," said she; "we haven't begun yet."</p>

  <p>I sat down again hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"Then," continued Miss Davies, "we take turns, starting with the word
  'margarine' and making a chain, each word being connected in some way
  with the one before it. And whoever can get to the word 'hippopotamus'
  first has won."</p>

  <p>"One hippopotamus?" asked John.</p>

  <p>"WON," said Miss Davies sweetly.</p>

  <p>Her brother groaned again.</p>

  <p>"I'll just give you an easy example," went on Miss Davies
  enthusiastically, "and then we'll begin. Take the words 'fire' and
  'nigger.' A good chain would be
  'fire&mdash;coal&mdash;black&mdash;nigger.' Do you see?</p>

  <p>John and I made sounds expressing that we thought we did. Davies just
  went on groaning.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Miss Davies, "we'll begin. Now don't forget. We
  start with 'margarine' and try to get to 'hippopotamus.' The great thing
  is to keep the word 'hippopotamus' in your mind all the time and keep
  trying to work towards it. Are you ready? Right! I'll start with
  'grease.'"</p>

  <p>"Greece?" said John, looking startled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, margarine&mdash;grease," explained Miss Davies.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," said John, "er&mdash;oil."</p>

  <p>I thought seriously for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Salad," I said, looking round for approval.</p>

  <p>"Splendid," said Miss Davies. "Now you, Arthur."</p>

  <p>"I refuse&mdash;Oh, all right," he said. "Where have
  we&mdash;'salad'&mdash;er&mdash;'lobster.'"</p>

  <p>Do you catch the idea, as it were? We seemed to fall into the way of
  it in a moment. Once we had tried we progressed at a tremendous rate.
  Perhaps we are all very clever, or perhaps it was really easier than it
  seems in the telling, but looking back the conversation seems to have
  been simply brilliant.</p>

  <p>Well, here's an idea of how we went on, anyway, and you can judge for
  yourselves (Davies, you remember, has just snapped out
  "Lobster"):&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Miss Davies</i> (quick as lightning). Shrimp.</p>

  <p><i>John</i>. Whiskers. (A very subtle one, this.)</p>

  <p><i>Me</i>. Beard. (Rather weak effort.) <span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>After this things went on for a long time, hours and hours I should
  say. I remember that we mentioned among many subjects of interest
  sausage-rolls, horoscopes, hair-pins, Cleopatra's Needle and lung-wort. I
  must resist the temptation to tell the whole absorbing story in detail,
  and skip rapidly to the point where the chase reached the following
  interesting stage:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Miss Davies</i> (still going strong). Whale.</p>

  <p><i>Me</i> (quite innocently). Grease.</p>

  <p><i>Davies</i> (triumphantly). <font class="sc">Margarine</font>.</p>

  <p>I looked at Miss Davies in embarrassment. John gazed round
  pitifully.</p>

  <p>"But," he murmured weakly, "isn't that where we started?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it is," said Miss Davies indignantly. "You've spoilt the
  whole game, Arthur."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't help it," said her brother; "I thought that was the
  word we were after. What was it, anyway?"</p>

  <p>We all looked at the sky and thought hard.</p>

  <p>"Hanged if I know," said John.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't," I said.</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't that ridiculous?" said Miss Davies.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is," said her brother brutally; "I <i>knew</i> it was
  ridiculous from the beginning. <i>You</i> said it quickened the mental
  processes. Would memory be one of them?"</p>

  <p>"Let's go inside and have some tea," said John.</p>

  <p>We crept quietly indoors.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Halfway through tea Miss Davies suddenly waved her teaspoon aloft. We
  looked at her and saw a great light shining in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hip&mdash;hip&mdash;hippopotamus!" she shrieked.</p>

  <p>We all agreed that Miss Davies had won.</p>

<h2>AWAY TO THE MEADOWS!</h2>

  <p>Although the cost of everything is on the rise there are still a few
  good things that quite a little money can buy. One pound, for
  example&mdash;or, if you prefer it, twenty shillings&mdash;can work
  wonders by taking (under the auspices of the Children's Country Holiday
  Fund) a London child away from our smoke and grime for a fortnight of
  country air and surprises, excitements and joys. The Fund (the Hon.
  Treasurer of which is the Earl of <font class="sc">Arran</font>, 18,
  Buckingham Street, Strand, London) must not now be restricted because
  lodgings and railway fares are dearer. Last year the sum asked for each
  child was just half what is now required; but the increase is necessary.
  Yet even with the increase it is not great, considering the good that it
  can do! In spite of all the other claims of the moment upon his readers'
  generosity, Mr. Punch trusts that this modest and most excellent
  ameliorative organisation will not be neglected.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

  <p><i>Monday, July 5th.</i>&mdash;When the Germans left Peking after the
  Boxer Rebellion they took with them the astronomical instruments which
  had hung for centuries on its walls. How the Celestial equivalent of
  <i>Old Moore</i> has managed to translate the message of the stars
  without their assistance I cannot imagine; but the Chinese Government
  does not appear to be worrying, for, though it was specifically provided
  at Versailles that the instruments should be returned, China has omitted
  to sign the Peace Treaty.</p>

    <p class="center"><font class="sc">Colonel Wedgwood</font>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>There are the makings of a great statesman in Sir <font
  class="sc">John Rees</font>. Some apprehension having been expressed lest
  France should prohibit the importation of silk mourning crêpe and so
  injure an old British industry, he was quick to suggest a remedy. "Would
  it not be possible," he asked in his most insinuating tones, "to have a
  deal between silk and champagne?" And the House, which is not yet
  entirely composed of "Pussyfeet," gave him an approving cheer.</p>

  <p>A certain General <font class="sc">Golovin</font> having published
  statements reflecting on Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill's</font> conduct
  of the campaign in North Russia last year, that section of the House
  which is always ready to take the word of any foreigner as against that
  of any Englishman, particularly of any English Minister, at once assumed
  that the charges were correct. The <font class="sc">Secretary of State
  for War</font> was in his place, with the light of battle in his eye,
  ready to meet his enemies in the gate. But by the time Mr. <font
  class="sc">Bonar Law</font> had done with them there was not much left of
  the charges. So far as the statements were true, he said, they merely
  repeated what was already familiar to the House. Everybody knew that the
  Government was helping the anti-Bolshevik forces last year. But the story
  that Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill</font> had taken his orders from
  Admiral <font class="sc">Koltchak</font> was both untrue and absurd. He
  had simply carried out the policy of the Government, a policy which,
  though some hon. Members did not seem to appreciate it, had now been
  altered.</p>

  <p>Committee on the Finance Bill saw the annual assault on the tea duty.
  "We are going to drop this duty directly we are in a position to do so,"
  said Commander <font class="sc">Kenworthy</font>, with his eye on the
  Treasury Bench. "Who are we?" shouted the Coalitionists; and it presently
  appeared that "we" did not include Sir <font class="sc">Donald
  Maclean</font>, but did include Colonel <font class="sc">Wedgwood</font>,
  who, as becomes one of his name, was all for a generous tea-pot.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Undeterred by his failure over tea, Commander <font
  class="sc">Kenworthy</font> next attacked the duty on films, complaining
  <i>inter alia</i>, "Mr. <font class="sc">Chaplin</font> is taxed twenty
  pounds for every thousand feet." Mr. <font class="sc">Chamberlain</font>
  defended the tax on general grounds, but wisely avoided Mr. <font
  class="sc">Chaplin's</font> feet, over which it is notoriously easy to
  trip.</p>

  <p>The debate on the beer duty shattered one more illusion. It is an
  article of faith with the "Wee Frees" that Sir <font class="sc">George
  Younger</font> is the power behind the scenes, and that Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lloyd George</font> is a mere marionette, who only exists to
  do his bidding. Yet here was the autocrat confessing, <i>quâ</i> brewer,
  that the latest addition to the beer duty was the biggest surprise of his
  life.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, July 6th.</i>&mdash;The <font class="sc">Lord
  Chancellor's</font> request for leave of absence in order that he might
  attend the Spa Conference was granted. Lord <font
  class="sc">Crewe's</font> remark, that it was "a matter of regret that
  the Government had to depend upon the noble and learned lord for legal
  assistance," might perhaps have been less ambiguously worded. At any rate
  Lord <font class="sc">Birkenhead</font> thought it necessary to allay any
  possible apprehensions by adding that he would be accompanied by the
  <font class="sc">Attorney-General</font>.</p>

  <p>The gist of Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill's</font> comprehensive
  reply to allegations of waste at Chilwell was that there were not enough
  sheds to cover all the stores, and that to build additional accommodation
  would cost more than it would save. There was a pleasant Hibernian
  flavour about his admission that the goods, "if they remained in their
  present condition, would, of course, deteriorate."</p>

  <p>Who says that D.O.R.A. has outlived her usefulness? The <font
  class="sc">Home Secretary</font> announced that the sale of chocolates in
  theatres is still <i>verboten</i>, so the frugal swain, whose "best girl"
  has a healthy appetite, may breathe again.</p>

    DAVID COPPERFIELD UP TO DATE.

    <p><i>Mr. Clynes.</i> "<font class="sc">Look here&mdash;if the price of
    ale keeps on going up like this I'll have to speak to Austen
    Chamberlain about it</font>."</p>
  </div>
  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Clynes</font>, usually so cautious, was in a
  reckless mood. First he tried to move the adjournment over the <font
  class="sc">Golovin</font> revelations, and was informed by the <font
  class="sc">Speaker</font> that a report of doubtful authenticity,
  relating to events that happened over a year ago, could hardly be
  described as either "urgent" or "definite."</p>

  <p>Next, on the Finance Bill, he shocked his temperance colleagues by
  boldly demanding cheaper beer. But, although he received the powerful
  support of Admiral Sir R. <font class="sc">Hall</font>, he failed to
  soften the heart of the <font class="sc">Chancellor</font>, who declared
  that he must have his increased revenue, and that the beer-drinker must
  pay his share of it.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Chamberlain</font> turned a more sympathetic ear
  to the bark of another sea-dog, Admiral <font class="sc">Adair</font>,
  who sought a reduction of the tax on champagne, and mentioned the
  horrifying fact that even City Companies were abandoning its consumption.
  He received the unexpected support of Lieutenant-Commander <font
  class="sc">Kenworthy</font>, who declared that Yorkshire miners always
  had a bottle after their day's work and denounced an impost that would
  rob a poor man of his "boy." Eventually the <font
  class="sc">Chancellor</font> agreed to reduce the new <i>ad valorem</i>
  duty by a third. He might have made the same reduction in the case of
  cigars but for the declaration of a Labour <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> Member that this was
  becoming "a rich man's Budget from top to bottom."</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, July 7th.</i>&mdash;Never was Lord Haldane's power of
  clear thinking employed to better advantage than in his lucid exposition
  of the Duplicands and Feu-duties (Scotland) Bill. I would not like to
  assert positively that all the Peers present fully grasped the momentous
  fact that a duplicand was a "casualty" and might be sometimes twice the
  feu-duty and sometimes three times that amount; but they understood
  enough to agree that it was a very fearful wild-fowl and ought to be
  restrained by law.</p>

  <p>After this piquant <i>hors-d'&#339;uvre</i> they settled down to a
  solid joint of national finance, laid before them by Lord <font
  class="sc">Midleton</font>. I am afraid they would have found it rather
  indigestible but for the sauce provided by Lord <font
  class="sc">Inchcape</font>, who was positively skittish in his comments
  upon the extravagance of the Government, and on one occasion even
  indulged in a pun. In his view the Ministry of Transport was an entirely
  superfluous creation, solely arising out of the supposed necessity of
  finding a new job for Sir <font class="sc">Eric Geddes</font>. I suppose
  the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> said, "Here's a square peg,
  look you; let us dig a hole round it."</p>

  <p>The <font class="sc">Lord Chancellor's</font> reply was vigorous but
  not altogether convincing. His description of the Government as a body of
  harassed and anxious economists did not altogether tally with his
  subsequent picture of the <font class="sc">Chancellor of the
  Exchequer</font> "always resisting proposals for expenditure made by his
  colleagues in the Cabinet." Despite his eloquence the Peers passed Lord
  <font class="sc">Midleton's</font> motion by 95 votes to 23.</p>

  <p>The Commons made good progress with the Finance Bill, though there was
  a good deal of justifiable criticism of its phraseology. The <font
  class="sc">Secretary of the Treasury</font> admitted that there was one
  clause of which he did not understand a word, but wisely refused to
  specify it. Colonel <font class="sc">Wedgwood</font> advanced the
  remarkable proposition that "the workers in the long run pay all the
  taxes," but did not jump at Captain <font class="sc">Elliott's</font>
  suggestion that in that case it would save trouble if the <font
  class="sc">Chancellor</font> were to levy all the taxes on the working
  classes direct. When asked to extend further relief to charities Mr.
  <font class="sc">Chamberlain</font> sought a definition of "charity."
  Would it apply, for example, to "the association of a small number of
  gentlemen in distress obeying the law of self-preservation in the face of
  world-forces which threaten to sweep them out of existence"? I seem to
  hear <i>Mr. Wilkins Micawber</i> reply, "The answer is in the
  affirmative."</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, July 8th.</i>&mdash;In the absence of the <font
  class="sc">Lord Chancellor</font> the Gas Regulation Bill was entrusted
  to the <font class="sc">Under-Secretary for Air</font>. The mingling of
  gas and air has before now been known to produce an explosion, but on
  this occasion Lord <font class="sc">Londonderry</font> so deftly handled
  his material that not a single Peer objected to the Second Reading.</p>

  <p>The proceedings in the Lower House were much more lively. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Stanton</font> threatened that there would be a general strike
  of Members of Parliament unless their salaries were increased; but Mr.
  <font class="sc">Bonar Law</font> seemed to be more amused than alarmed
  at the prospect. The <font class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</font>
  was asked point-blank whether he was satisfied with the reduction in the
  bureaucracy during the last six months, and replied that he was not, and
  had therefore appointed Committees to investigate the staffs in seven of
  the Departments. The number is unfortunately suggestive.</p>

  <p>And we know what the Carpenter replied.</p>

  <p>If an unnecessary amount of heat was engendered by the debate on
  General <font class="sc">Dyer's</font> case the fault must be partly
  attributed to the <font class="sc">Indian Secretary's</font> opening
  speech. "Come, Montagu, for thou art early up" is a line from one of the
  most poignant scenes in <font class="sc">Shakspeare</font>; but early
  rising, at Westminster as elsewhere, is not always conducive to good
  temper.</p>

  <p>Members who thought with Sir <font class="sc">Edward Carson</font>
  that General <font class="sc">Dyer</font> had not been fairly treated
  resented Mr. <font class="sc">Montagu's</font> insinuation that in that
  case they were condoning "frightfulness." Mr. <font
  class="sc">Churchill</font> was more judicious, and Mr. <font
  class="sc">Bonar Law</font> did his level best to keep his followers in
  the Government Lobby. But Sir <font class="sc">A. Hunter-Weston's</font>
  reminder that by the instructions issued by the civil authority to
  General <font class="sc">Dyer</font> he was ordered "to use all force
  necessary. No gathering of persons nor procession of any sort will be
  allowed. All gatherings will be fired on," confirmed them in the view
  that the <font class="sc">General</font> was being made a scape-goat. No
  fewer than 129 voted against the Government, whose majority would have
  been very minute but for the assistance of its usual foes, the "Wee
  Frees" and Labourites.</p>

  <p>A returning circumnavigator reports that the passengers on the
  boat&mdash;a Japanese liner&mdash;coming from Yokohama to Honolulu were
  apprised of the fact that they were to have two Thursdays, one
  immediately following the other (and you can have no notion how long a
  second Thursday can be), owing to the crossing of the imaginary but very
  boring line which divides the two hemispheres. The official notice came
  from the captain's own hand. The ship had an American purser and an

<h2>OUR PASTORAL.</h2>

  <p>"Hulloa, Melhuish," I said, "after all you had ideal weather for your
  <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i> yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Ideal," said Melhuish moodily.</p>

  <p>"Really, if you'd picked the day it couldn't have been better. You
  want peculiar atmospheric conditions for a pastoral, don't you? Just
  enough sun, not too much wind, temperature congenial for sitting
  out-of-doors. You had 'em all."</p>

  <p>Melhuish nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your garden must be looking like fairyland too now with the roses out
  and the trees in all their full summer greenery."</p>

  <p>He nodded again.</p>

  <p>"What a setting for the <i>Dream</i>! It drew a crowd, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we drew the county."</p>

  <p>I sighed regretfully. "How I wish I hadn't funked it, but with my
  lumbago I never dare risk damp grass and it looked so awfully like rain
  in the morning."</p>

  <p>Melhuish suddenly got excited. "<i>Looked</i> like rain!" he said
  violently. "It <i>did</i> rain. It rained several drops. I never saw such
  drops, as big as saucers. Perhaps you didn't hear the thunder?"</p>

  <p>"My dear bean," I said, "it was the thunder which put me off coming to
  see you as <i>Bottom</i> and Mrs. Melhuish as <i>Titania</i> in the most
  idyllic surroundings I can imagine."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't have seen us in any idyllic surroundings," said
  Melhuish. He had relapsed into moodiness again. I could see there was
  something serious.</p>

  <p>"What happened, old friend?" I said gently.</p>

  <p>"We began rehearsing during that glorious spell of sunshine in the
  spring, when the garden was a carpet of daffodils and it was a sheer joy
  to play about out-of-doors. Then the weather broke for a time and we
  migrated to the Parish Hall. You know our Parish Hall?"</p>

  <p>"Quite well. A little tin place on the left from the rectory."</p>

  <p>"That's it. It's got a platform on trestles at one end and a paraffin
  lamp in the middle. The Vicar placed it at our disposal when there wasn't
  a Women's Institute or a choir practice, and on chilly nights he had the
  'Beatrice stove' lit for us. Then the Summer began in real earnest. We
  got in extra gardeners, worked like niggers ourselves, and when the turf
  was in perfect condition and the thyme was coming up on <i>Titania's</i>
  bank we fixed the date and billed the county.</p>

  <p>"After that we all got nervous and went about consulting weather
  forecasts. <i>Old Moore</i> prophesied heavy rains. The <i>Daily Mail</i>
  said a cyclone from New York was on the way. The weather-glasses jumped
  about and seemed to know their own minds even less than usual. Three days
  before the date thunderstorms were reported all over the country and a
  fowl was struck by lightning. But not a drop of rain came to our
  village.</p>

  <p>"At the dress-rehearsal the night before the performance we debated
  the weather prospects until the moon rose. <i>Lysander</i> said his bit
  of seaweed which he brought from Bognor was as dry as parched peas and he
  would back it against any fool barometer. Cocklewhite, our prompter, said
  he didn't want to depress the company, but he had a leech in a bottle of
  water which rose for fine weather and sank for wet, and he was bound to
  tell us it was like lead at the bottom at the present moment.
  <i>Hermia</i> pointed to the heavens, 'Red sky at night shepherds'
  delight,' she quoted. There was no getting away from the swallows; they
  were nose-diving to a bird. 'Hang swallows,' <i>Oberon</i> said; 'put
  your trust in mosquitoes. Look at my eyelid.'</p>

  <p>"'It's no good talking,' <i>Theseus</i> said; 'nobody can tell until
  the morning, and then it'll be up to <i>Bottom</i> to decide by 11.30
  whether it's to be indoors or out. He's our stage-manager and we know his
  arrangements in case of rain. They're the only arrangements possible in
  our little village, and it's going to be a nightmare instead of a dream
  if they have to be carried out. But we can depend upon <i>Bottom</i> to
  make a wise decision. He'll notify us and the boy-scouts will notify the
  audience. All we've got to do is not to grouse.'</p>

  <p>"Cocklewhite said he would phone me the position of his leech at 9
  <font class="sc">a.m.</font>, and <i>Lysander</i> promised to report any
  change in the condition of the seaweed. I set our glass and
  <i>Titania</i> and I got up at half-hour intervals during the night and
  tapped it. It refused to budge either way.</p>

  <p>"At dawn <i>Titania</i> looked out of the window and gave a wild cry.
  'Red sky in the morning shepherds' warning,' she wailed. At breakfast
  Cocklewhite phoned that his leech was dead, and he had strong suspicions
  it had died from atmospheric pressure. Almost at the same moment
  <i>Lysander</i> sent word that his seaweed had gone clammy during the
  night. Half-an-hour later came a clap of thunder and the drops of rain I
  mentioned. I needn't go on. You can guess the rest."</p>

  <p>Melhuish paused.</p>

  <p>"But the performance came off, didn't it?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, in the Parish Hall. It was a perfect day for a pastoral."</p>

<h3>A STORY ABOUT A CLOCK.</h3>

  <p>Our move-in took place in no furtive or clandestine fashion; our
  installation of ourselves in our semi-detached was performed well under
  the eye of the neighbouring public. Our furniture waited on the public
  thoroughfare until our new home was ready to receive it. Small children
  played games on our sofa; enthusiastic acquaintances played tunes on our
  piano. In a word, our move-in was a local festival; everyone took part.
  This is the sad tale of the man who took the most expensive
  part&mdash;the clock.</p>

  <p>If the hard choice had been put to Diana, my wife, to say which she
  could least sorrowfully part with, me or the clock, the clock would have
  stayed. If I had been put to the same dismal alternative as to Diana or
  the clock, Diana would have gone. In fact, directly the clock was safely
  in Diana had gone out. That was all she cared about; small children might
  play on the sofa, enthusiastic acquaintances might play on the piano, and
  I might toil unremittingly with everything else, for all Diana cared. So,
  the clock being in, out she went upon her lawful or unlawful purposes. As
  she departed she said something about my seeing to the clock. I
  remembered that later on, but I remembered it wrong. This is how I did
  it.</p>

  <p>The man sat a little on my own special chair (at that time on the
  pavement) before he came in. I asked him what he was sitting there for.
  He got up and came inside. Then I asked him what he had come in for, and
  he said, "The clock." I looked at the clock and it had stopped. I gave it
  a shake, and it still stopped. He said it was no good shaking it; that
  only annoyed it. He said he had come to look after it. He then took off
  his hat and his coat, moved the fingers about, put his ears to it to hear
  its heart beating, and asked me what I had been doing to it. I said I
  hadn't been doing anything to it; he watched me doing things to
  everything else, and adopted an expression as if to say he didn't believe
  me. He gave me the feeling that I was a very interfering person, and that
  he didn't want to have anything more to do with me. He said he should
  have to take the clock away. I asked him when he would bring it back. He
  said he didn't know. He appeared to take a pessimistic view of it. I
  asked him cheerfully if he would <i>ever</i> bring it back. He gave me a
  contemptuous look and, without another word, went, taking the clock with
  him.</p>

  <p>When Diana came back she asked where the clock was. I said it had
  gone. "Gone where?" asked Diana. I said I didn't know; the man had taken
  it. "What man?" asked Diana. I was trying to move the sofa at the moment
  and I was inclined to be short-spoken. I said that the man who had taken
  it was, no doubt, the man whom Diana had gone forth to find and bid take
  away our clock. Diana said that, if the man had said that she had said
  that he might take our clock away, the man was a liar. <i>Had</i> the man
  said that she had said he might take the clock away? The answer was in
  the negative.</p>

  <p>Then the truth emerged. The man had stolen our clock. I had assisted
  the man to steal our clock, helping him to lift it off its perch and
  handing him his bowler hat as he left.</p>

  <p>It all sounds incredible, doesn't it? But you will admit, I am sure,
  that it is a thing which could quite easily happen to anyone. Isn't
  it?</p>

  <p>To be quite frank, I have improved the story a bit. The clock wasn't
  really stolen.</p>

  <p>Was the man really taking it away to repair it? No; to tell you the
  truth he didn't actually take it away at all. In fact, I might as well
  own that no man ever came into the house while I was shifting the
  furniture in from the street. And, if you want to know, I never had a
  clock ... nor a wife ... nor a house.</p>

  <p>The mere fact of my pretending that there <i>are</i> such things as
  semi-detacheds for people to move into these days ought to have put you
  wise from the start that the whole tale was a fabrication.</p>

<h3>CURES WORTH MAKING.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>By our Medical Expert.</i>)</p>

  <p><i>The Times</i>, in its daily summary of "News in Advertisements"
  recently called attention to the appeal of an invalided officer who "will
  be glad to give a hundred pounds to any doctor, nerve specialist or
  hospital that can cure him of occupation neurosis and writer's cramp." A
  careful study of other newspapers shows that offers of handsome
  remuneration for cures are not confined to those who have suffered from
  the War, but are made by civilians and officials of the highest position
  in public life. We append a few outstanding examples of the splendid
  opportunities now provided to psycho-pathological specialists:&mdash;</p>

  <p>A Cabinet Minister of massive physique, perfect self-confidence and
  immovable determination, who has had varied experience in different
  business callings and (up to a certain point) unvarying success, offers
  five thousand pounds to any professor of deportment or member of the Old
  Nobility in reduced circumstances who will impart to him suavity of
  manner, tact and diplomatic courtesy, the lack of which constitutes the
  sole obstacle to his achieving immortality. If the instructor can succeed
  in making him (the Cabinet Minister) really beloved the honorarium will
  be doubled.</p>

  <p>An Editor of thirty years' experience as a journalist, first-rate
  linguist, deeply versed in geography, Central European politics, etc.,
  will give five hundred pounds to any mental specialist, registered or
  unregistered, who will cure him of an irresistible temptation on all
  occasions, with or without provocation, to utilise every incident,
  occurrence, calamity or disaster as a means of assailing and undermining
  the position of the Coalition Government in general and the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister</font> in particular.</p>

  <p>A Member of Parliament, formerly attached to one of His Majesty's
  services, is prepared to offer fifty pounds to any phrenologist who
  without inflicting undue pain will reduce or remove the Bump of Curiosity
  which at present impels him without rhyme or reason to bombard Ministers
  with irrelevant questions contrary to the public interest and calculated
  to produce the maximum amount of irritation even amongst Members who sit
  on the same side of the House.</p>

  <p>A Peer of great wealth, striking physiognomy, affectionate disposition
  and wonderful general knowledge will pay the sum of twenty thousand
  pounds to any psychiatric practitioner who succeeds in eliminating from
  his system the microbe of filmolatry, the ravages of which have latterly
  threatened to infect his monumental mind with histrionic monomania highly
  deleterious to the best interests of the community.</p>

  <p>A neo-Georgian poet, disciple of <font class="sc">Freud</font>,
  pacificist and vegetarian, will gladly pay five pounds to any
  psychopathic suggestionist who will extirpate from his subconsciousness
  the lingering relics of an antipathy to syncopated rhythms which retard
  his progress towards a complete mastery of the technique of amorphous
  bombination.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p><i>Rescue</i> (<font class="sc">Dent</font>) is a story in the
  authentic manner of Mr. <font class="sc">Joseph Conrad</font> at his
  unapproachable best. If it is true, as one has heard, that the book was
  begun twenty-five years ago and resumed lately, this explains but does
  nothing to minimize a fact upon which we can all congratulate ourselves.
  The setting is the shallow seas of the Malay coast, where <i>Lingard</i>,
  an adventurer (most typically <font class="sc">Conrad</font>) whose
  passion in life is love for his brig, has pledged himself to aid an
  exiled young Rajah in the recovery of his rights. At the last moment
  however, when his plans are at point of action, the whole scheme is
  thwarted by the stranding of a private yacht containing certain persons
  whose rescue (complicated by his sudden subjection to the woman of the
  party) eventually involves <i>Lingard</i> in the loss of fortune and
  credit. Perhaps you can suppose what Mr. <font class="sc">Conrad</font>
  makes of a theme so congenial; how the tale moves under his hand in what
  was once well called that "smoky magnificence" of atmosphere, just
  permitting the reader to observe at any moment so much and no more of its
  direction. Of the style it would now be superfluous to speak. It has been
  given to Mr. <font class="sc">Conrad</font>, working in what is
  originally a foreign medium, to use it with a dignity unsurpassed by any
  of our native craftsmen. Such phrases as (of the prudent mate
  remonstrating with <i>Lingard</i>): "What he really wanted was to have
  his existence left intact, for his own cherishing and pride;" or again,
  "The situation was too complicated to be entrusted to a cynical or
  shameless hope," give one the quick pleasure of words so delicately and
  deftly used as to seem newly coined. <i>Rescue</i>, in short, is probably
  the greatest novel of the year, one by which its author has again
  enriched our literature with work of profound and moving quality.</p>

<hr />

  <p>I was inclined to flatter myself that nothing in the plot of <i>The
  Silver Tea-shop</i> (<font class="sc">Stanley Paul</font>) could possibly
  take me by surprise, but I found towards the end that Miss <font
  class="sc">E. Everett Green</font> had contrived to slip in the real
  villain all unsuspected while I, as she meant me to, was staring hard at
  the supposed one, so that there I must acknowledge myself defeated. With
  a stolen invention, an old gentleman found shot in his room, and a son
  under a vow to avenge his father, the story provides plenty of thrills,
  and the "Silver Tea-shop" itself has the fascination that business
  ventures in books often exercise. It seems to be run on such lavish lines
  for the prices charged that I found myself looking hungrily for its
  address. I wish the author had not referred to her hero as having "mobile
  digits" and burdened her ingenuous story with anything so important as a
  prologue. By making the villain's deserted offspring not one baby girl
  only, or even twins, but triplets, Miss <font class="sc">Everett
  Green</font> provides waitresses all of one family for the "Silver
  Tea-shop," and that, though a happy arrangement, is a little too uncommon
  to add to the likelihood of an unconvincing tale.</p>

<hr />

  <p>When a book is succinctly labelled <i>Love Stories</i> (<font
  class="sc">Doran</font>), at least no one has any right to complain that
  he wasn't warned beforehand of the character of its contents. As a matter
  of fact, human nature being what it is, I have little doubt that Mrs.
  <font class="sc">Mary Roberts Rinehart</font> has hit upon a distinctly
  profitable title. Indeed I believe that this has already been proved in
  the Land of Freedom, from which the work comes to us, where (I am given
  to understand) the vogue of sentimental fiction is even greater than with
  ourselves. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg
  40]</span> What the name does nothing to indicate is that the stories are
  almost all of them laid in or about hospital wards. For some, perhaps
  most, of the author's admirers this may serve only to increase the charm;
  for others, who prefer their romance unflavoured with iodoform, not.
  Undeniable that she has a smiling way with her, and a gift of sympathetic
  enjoyment that carries off the old, old dialogues, even imparting
  freshness to the tale of the patient <i>in extremis</i> who persuades his
  attractive nurse into a death-bed marriage, treatment that the slightest
  experience of fiction should have warned her to be invariably curative.
  Perhaps the best of the tales is "Jane," which tells very amusingly the
  results of a hospital strike that in actual life would, I imagine, have
  provided little humorous relief. By this time you may have gathered that
  what matters about Mrs. <font class="sc">Rinehart</font> is not what she
  says but the way that she says it; upon which hint you can act as fancy
  dictates.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I very distinctly feel that "<font class="sc">Katharine Tynan</font>"
  could have made a first-rate novel of <i>Denys the Dreamer</i> (<font
  class="sc">Collins</font>) and have had plenty over for a good second if
  she had taken the trouble. But her fluent pen runs away with her down
  paths that lead nowhere in particular, instead of developing her main
  characters and situations to an intelligible and satisfactory point.
  <i>Denys</i> is of a gentle Irish family that has come down to very small
  farming. He dreams good, solid and rather Anglo-Saxon dreams of draining
  bogs on the sea-coast estates of <i>Lord Leenane</i>, whose agent he
  becomes (and whose daughter he loves from afar), and of a great port that
  is to rival Belfast. Unexpected, not to say incredible, assistance comes
  from a Jew money-lender and his wife. The portraits of <i>Mr.</i> and
  <i>Mrs. Aarons</i> are the best things in the book, and I hope Mrs. <font
  class="sc">Hinkson</font> will make a novel about these two admirable
  people some day soon. <i>Denys</i> makes his own and his patron's fortune
  and I am sure lives happily ever after with <i>Dawn</i>, who is the
  palest wraith of a girl, owing to the shameful neglect of her author, who
  is too busy putting large sums of money into the pockets of the principal
  puppets. Indeed, for a West Coast of Ireland story a demoralising amount
  of money is going about.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The principal scenes of <i>The North Door</i> (<font
  class="sc">Constable</font>) are laid in the Cornwall of some
  hundred-and-thirty years ago, and I welcome Dr. <font class="sc">Greville
  Macdonald</font> as an expert in the Cornish language and character.
  Cornwall, as all readers of fiction know, has during the last few years
  been attacked again and again by novelists, and most of them would do
  well to study Dr. <font class="sc">Macdonald's</font> romance and most
  thoroughly to digest it. In form, however, he will have little to teach
  them, for his book is very indifferently constructed. It may seem
  ungrateful in these rather skimpy days to complain of a surfeit of
  matter, but there is stuff in this book for two if not three novels. One
  cannot blame Dr. <font class="sc">Macdonald</font> for his indignation at
  the miseries of child-labour, but here it is perhaps out of place. His
  <i>Mr. Trevenna</i>, the mystical parson, friend of smugglers and of
  everyone who suffered from laws (unrighteous or righteous), is a great
  figure; and I shall not soon forget either his correspondence with
  <i>Lady Evangeline Walrond</i> or his superhuman kindliness of heart. If
  you want to get at the true flavour of Cornwall you have only to open
  <i>The North Door</i>.</p>

<hr />

  <p>A young clerk in an insurance office, who wanted to go as a missionary
  to India, is the hero, if there is one, of Mrs. <font class="sc">Alice
  Perrin's</font> latest novel, <i>The Vow of Silence</i> (<font
  class="sc">Cassell</font>). I have never read a book about India which
  made such an ambition seem more courageous, for it gives such a hot and
  thirsty picture of that country when <i>Harold Williams</i> at last
  reaches it that it is positively uncomfortable to read it in Summer
  weather. <i>Harold</i> and his brother and sister missionaries live in a
  state of stuffy discomfort which soon undermines his health and leaves
  him no defence against the charms of <i>Elaine Taverner</i>, who has a
  large cool drawing-room and dainty frocks, and a young soldier lover and
  an old scholar husband, and all the other things we expect of pretty
  young women in Anglo-Indian novels. Poor <i>Harold</i>, consumed at once
  by a zeal which makes him long to save <i>Elaine's</i> soul and a passion
  which makes him embrace a parcel of her <i>lingerie</i>, very naturally
  loses the remains of his reason and paves the way for her marriage with
  her lover by obligingly pushing the elderly husband into the jaws of a
  crocodile. If it were more convincing it would be a painful
  story&mdash;in some hands it might have been a great one; as it is, Mrs.
  <font class="sc">Perrin</font> seems for once to have missed her
  opportunity.</p>

<hr />

  <p>If the publisher of <i>About It And About</i> had told me on the
  wrapper that Mr. <font class="sc">D. Willoughby</font> has an excellent
  fund of literary reminiscence, on which he draws for the modelling of a
  very pretty epigrammatical style, I should, after reading the book, have
  agreed with him heartily. What Mr. <font class="sc">T. Fisher
  Unwin</font> does say about these short essays, which embrace most of the
  subjects on which people have violent opinions, is that the author's
  "point of view is that of the natural historian making an unprejudiced
  examination." An unprejudiced man, I take it, is a man whose sentiments
  are the same as mine, and I happen to disagree with Mr. <font
  class="sc">Willoughby</font> as profoundly as possible on several of the
  themes he has chosen. On fox-hunting, for instance, which he considers a
  more decadent sport than bull-fighting; and on Ulster, which he attacks
  bitterly by comparison with the rest of Ireland, for cherishing
  antiquated political animosities and talking about the Battle of the
  Boyne. But will Mr. <font class="sc">Willoughby</font> not have been
  hearing of "the curse of <font class="sc">Cromwell</font>"? Let us rather
  agree to be impatient with Yorkshire for her absurd tranquillity with
  regard to <font class="sc">William the First</font>. I repeat that Mr.
  <font class="sc">Willoughby</font> has a very clever style, but, bless
  his heart, he is as bigoted as I am myself.</p>

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
